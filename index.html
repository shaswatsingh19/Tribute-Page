    <li><strong>1919 : </strong>On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them.

    <li><strong>1924 : </strong>The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions. Gandhi was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only two years.</li>
    <li><strong>1929 : </strong>On 31 December 1929, the flag of India was unfurled in Lahore. Gandhi led Congress celebrated 26 January 1930 as India's Independence Day in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation.</li>

Thousands of Indians joined him on this march to the sea. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way.</li>

    <li><strong>1942 : </strong>At the time of World War 2 , Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai.</li>

In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.</li>
    <li><strong>1947 : </strong>The partition was controversial and violently disputed. More than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10 million to 12 million non-Muslims (Hindus, Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.</li>
    <li><strong>1947 : </strong>Gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947.
